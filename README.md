# Hospital-Management-System

## Project Overview

This project is a Hospital Management System designed to manage hospital data efficiently using a relational database model.

The database includes core hospital entities such as patients, doctors, departments, appointments, and billing records. It demonstrates proper database design, relationships, and SQL implementation.

## Objectives

* Design a relational database with proper entity relationships
* Implement primary and foreign key constraints
* Insert sample data into all tables
* Demonstrate SQL operations including:

  * INNER JOIN
  * LEFT / RIGHT JOIN
  * Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG)
  * Subquery
  * View creation
  * Transaction (COMMIT / ROLLBACK)
